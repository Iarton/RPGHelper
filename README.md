# RPGHelper
I want to create something to help my Develop my RPG's campaign, and i want to have a more in deepth knowledge about Java, so i mix both of then and made this project.
The primaty objectives for now is a NPC creator integrated with DataBase and a hexadecimal Map creator(I dont even know how to start this, so i am very eager to see how this goes).
The RPG System used is my HomeBrew.
